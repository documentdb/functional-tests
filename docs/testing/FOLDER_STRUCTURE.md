# Folder Structure Guide

## Core Principles

1. **Feature-specific tests** → dedicated subfolders. Test only the feature's own inputs and edge cases, not lower-level features it contains (those are tested in their own directories).
2. **Cross-cutting features** (rbac, transactions, collation, namespace rules, etc.) → own top-level folders, NOT under feature-specific folders (e.g., rbac with find goes under `/tests/rbac/`, not `/tests/find/`). When a command accepts a cross-cutting feature as a parameter (e.g., collation field on aggregate), the command tests only that the field is syntactically accepted (type acceptance/rejection, one valid case). Sub-field validation and semantic behavior live in the feature's own directory. Exception: parameters whose behavior genuinely varies per command (readConcern, writeConcern) are tested exhaustively per command including sub-fields.
3. **Collection type as input** — when a command or operator accepts different collection types (views, capped, timeseries), test one representative case per type showing it works. The collection type's own semantics (pipeline composition, eviction, chaining) belong in the type's feature directory.
4. **Feature levels** — higher-level features (e.g., `find`, `$group`, `$lookup`) contain lower-level features (e.g., `projection`, `$sum`, `$unwind`). Higher-level tests only verify lower-level features are supported (1-2 cases) and test combinations of lower-level features. Lower-level features test their own edge cases in their own directories.
5. **Integration tests** (multiple same-level features interacting) → parent folders. Example: `{$add: [{$subtract: [2, 1]}, 3]}` tests multiple operators working together (operator combination/nesting), not a single operator's edge cases — goes in `expressions/test_expression_combination.py`, not `expressions/arithmetic/add/`. Single operator edge cases (null handling, type errors, boundary values) stay in the operator's own folder.
6. **Operators** → comprehensive tests in `/tests/operators/{type}/$operator/`, only 1-2 integration cases elsewhere.

7. **File organization** — a feature folder can have multiple files if a single file would exceed ~200 lines. Group test cases logically by aspect (e.g., by parameter, by error type). Example:
```
/tests/aggregate/unwind/
├── test_unwind_path.py                           # path parameter
├── test_unwind_preserve_null_and_empty_arrays.py # preserveNullAndEmptyArrays option
└── test_unwind_combined_options.py               # multiple options together
```

8. **Non-test files in a test folder** — a test folder may contain a few non-test Python files, which the structure validator exempts from the `test_`-prefix and parent-name naming rules: `__init__.py`, `conftest.py`, and any module under a `utils/` or `fixtures/` subfolder. Shared *logic and test data* live in `utils/`; `conftest.py` holds shared pytest *fixtures* scoped to that directory (e.g. an autouse baseline, or package-scoped setup).

## Decision Tree

**Step 1: Cross-cutting feature?** (rbac, transactions, collation, geospatial, text_search, validation, ttl)
→ YES: `/tests/{feature}/`

**Step 2: Operator?** ($in, $gt, $sum, $add, etc.)
→ YES comprehensive: `/tests/operators/{type}/$operator/`
→ YES integration: 1-2 cases in the higher-level feature that uses it (e.g., `$sum` in `$group/`, `$add` in `$project/`, `$gt` in `$match/`+`$expr/`)

**Step 3: Single parameter/option of a feature?**
→ YES: feature subfolder (e.g., `/tests/aggregate/unwind/`)

**Container features** ($expr, $match, $lookup): under the container's directory, only test that sub-features work inside it — one test case per sub-feature, no edge cases. Edge cases belong in each sub-feature's own directory.
- `$expr/` → one test per operator usable inside $expr
- `$lookup/` → 1-2 cases per pipeline sub-stage

See `TEST_COVERAGE.md` §11 for expression-operator containers and §21 for query-operator containers.

**Step 4: Interaction between multiple same-level features?**
→ YES: parent folder (e.g., `{$add: [{$subtract: ...}]}` tests expression nesting, not `$add` itself — goes in `expressions/`, not `add/`)


**Step 5: Basic operation behavior?**
→ operation folder (e.g., `/tests/find/test_basic_queries.py`)

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Cross-cutting tests in operation folders
- ❌ Comprehensive operator tests outside `/operators/`
- ❌ Integration tests in feature subfolders (they belong in parent)
- ❌ 200+ test functions in one file (split by feature)


## Feature Tree

The test directory structure maps to the DocumentDB feature taxonomy defined in [`docs/feature-tree.csv`](../feature-tree.csv).

Each row in the CSV represents a feature path:
```
Category,Subcategory1,Subcategory2,Subcategory3,Subcategory4,Item
```

Example mappings:
| Feature | CSV Path | Test Directory |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| `$group` stage | `core,operator,aggregation,pipeline,-,group` | `tests/core/operator/stages/group/` |
| `$sum` accumulator | `core,operator,aggregation,accumulators,-,sum` | `tests/core/operator/accumulators/sum/` |
| `$mul` update | `core,operator,update,fields,-,mul` | `tests/core/operator/update/fields/mul/` |
| `find` command | `core,crud,commands,-,-,find` | `tests/find/` |

Use the feature tree to:
- Determine where a new test file should go
- Find related tests by feature hierarchy
- Ensure complete coverage across feature areas
